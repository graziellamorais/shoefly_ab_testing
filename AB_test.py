Analysis:
Ad A consistently outperformed Ad B in terms of click percentage on most days:

Ad A had a higher click rate than Ad B on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday.
Ad B only performed better on Tuesday and Saturday â€” but the differences weren't very large.
Highest engagement for Ad A:

Thursday (40.52%) and Friday (39.84%) had the highest click rates for Ad A.
Ad A maintained a relatively stable click rate, hovering around 38%...40% on most days.
Lowest engagement for Ad B:

Ad B performed worst on Thursday (25%) and Wednesday (28.23%).
It's highest performance was on Tuesday (37.82%) and Saturday (35.59%), but still not consistently better than Ad A.
